# 🎓 Student Score Card Prediction

## 📌 Project Definition
**Student Score Card Prediction** is a machine learning–based project that predicts a student’s academic score using supervised learning techniques. The model learns the relationship between input features (such as study-related parameters) and the final score to make accurate predictions.

## 📂 Project Overview
- Implements a complete **machine learning workflow**.
- Uses **regression algorithms** for score prediction.
- Designed for **academic labs, mini-projects, and ML beginners**.
- Demonstrates data preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Preprocess the data  
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
4. Train the regression model  
5. Evaluate model performance  
6. Predict student scores  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
## 📊 Output
- Predicted student score  
- Accuracy and evaluation metrics  
- Graphical visualization of results  

## 📚 Use Cases
- Student performance analysis  
- Educational data mining  
- Machine learning practice
